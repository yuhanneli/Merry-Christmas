            Thank you for everything, honey. Thank you for everything you have given me. You gave me more than what I
            ever deserved. I don't know what I did in the past life to deserve such a wonderful girl like you. You are
            my joy. You forever will be. I know I already said most of them to you, But I always feel like it's never
            going to be enough. I can write you a poem that is so beautifully written, but I will never feel like it's
            gonna enough. I cannot express how I love you. I just do, really. You are the greatest gift the universe has
            every given me. I'm so happy to have a chance to date such a wonderful woman like you. You are the
            prettiest. I love you till this universe we live in will in blow of into a million pieces.
        </p>

            You're the only girl I would do anything for. Losing you would suck. So Please. Stay with me, hun. You've
            made it this far and I'm sure we're not afraid to go futher more at the road. You are worth more than
            anything. I love you, Always.
